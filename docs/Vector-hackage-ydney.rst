data, library ] [ Propose Tags ]. Efficient algorithms for sorting vector arrays. At some stage other vector algorithms may be added. A wrapper for an arbitrary Vector with O(1) reverse. Instead of creating a copy, it just flips a flag, which inverts indexing. The vector package represents unboxed arrays of Bool spending 1 byte (8 bits) per boolean. This library provides a newtype wrapper Bit and a.
